    "\n",
    "### 2.1 How Bootstrap Works\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 The Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"The sample is to the population as the bootstrap sample is to the sample.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Population} \\longrightarrow \\text{Sample} \\longrightarrow \\text{Bootstrap Sample}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This expresses a nested analogy of how information flows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Level | What it Represents | What We Know | What We Want |\n",
    "|-------|-------------------|--------------|--------------|\n",
    "| **Population** | The real world (true distribution $F$) | Unknown | Theoretical sampling distribution of our estimator |\n",
    "| **Sample** | Our finite dataset (empirical distribution $\\hat{F}$) | Known | Approximation of the population |\n",
    "| **Bootstrap Sample** | A resample from the sample (with replacement) | We can generate many | Approximation of how the estimator would vary across repeated samples from $F$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 In Words\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **We only have one dataset** from an unknown population.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If we could **repeatedly sample from the true population**, we'd see how our estimator (mean, regression coefficient, slip rate, etc.) fluctuates — that's the **true sampling distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **But we can't resample the population** — it's gone! \n",
    "\n",
    "4. So we **pretend the sample we have is a mini-version of the population**.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Then:\n",
    "   - Each **bootstrap sample** (drawn with replacement from our data) **mimics what would happen** if we took a new sample from the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, conceptually:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Population} \\xrightarrow{\\text{sample once}} \\text{Sample} \\xrightarrow{\\text{resample many times}} \\text{Bootstrap samples}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the **distribution of estimates from bootstrap samples** approximates the **distribution of estimates from true samples**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine measuring **vertical GPS velocities at 20 stations** near a fault.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **true region** (all possible GPS sites) = **population**\n",
    "- Your **20 observed stations** = **sample**  \n",
    "- Each **bootstrap resample** (20 points drawn with replacement from those 20) = **bootstrap sample**\n",
    "\n",
    "You fit your fault-slip model to each bootstrap sample. The **spread of estimated slip rates** across those resamples tells you:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"If I had gone back and measured a different random set of 20 GPS stations from the same population, how much might my estimated slip rate have varied?\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "**That's the bootstrap principle in action.**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Bootstrap Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step procedure**:\n",
    "1. **Original dataset**: $\\{\\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{t}\\}$ with $N$ observations\n",
    "2. **Create bootstrap sample**: Randomly sample $N$ points **with replacement**\n",
    "3. **Solve inverse problem**: Find $\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_b$ for bootstrap sample\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Generate $B$ bootstrap samples (typically $B = 1000-10000$)\n",
    "5. **Analyze distribution**: Compute statistics from $\\{\\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_1, \\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_2, ..., \\hat{\\mathbf{m}}_B\\}$\n",

    "✅ **Flexible**: Works with any optimization algorithm  \n",
    "✅ **Bias correction**: Can detect and correct estimator bias  \n",

    "### 2.4 Bootstrap Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Computational cost**: Requires $B$ complete optimizations  \n",
    "❌ **Sample dependence**: Quality depends on original sample representativeness  \n",
